ubl# Ponsify

Ponsify is a simple test for software engineers.

Difficulty: **Easy**

## Scope
The scope of this test is to assess the candidate's basic knowledge of software engineering principles, their ability to learn, work in a team and follow instructions.

## Problem Definition
Implement a function `ponsify(lowerLimit, upperLimit, step)` that sums all the integers from the first parameter, the lower limit; to the second parameter, the upper limit (both inclusive); going in steps expressed as the third parameter.

```
	ponsify(1, 10, 1) // should return the sum of 1+ 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 
	ponsify(2, 12, 3) // should return the sum of 2 + 5 + 8 + 11
	ponsify(5, 4, 2) // should return 0 as the range is invalid 
	ponsify(3, 3, 2) // should return 3
```

You may assume that both the upper, lower limit and step are all positive integers.

## Instructions
- Fork the repository using your own GitHub account.
- Give collaborator access to your interviewer(s) (using their email address).
- Run `npm install` on the root directory to install any dependencies.
- You may implement your solution in `main.js` in the `/src` folder.
- Run the command `npm run build` to minify, prepare your solution and run any tests. If not all tests are passed then your solution is not complete. If the tests are passed then your solution is returning the correct result; however you will also be assesed on the method.
- When you are satisfied, commit and push your changes and create a pull request and assign your interviewer.

## Prerequisites
The test does not require any prior knowledge of the problem definition, however basic knowledge of the JavaScript language is required.

## Important Notes
- Keep your code nice and tidy.
- No JavaScript frameworks are required (no jQuery, Angular, React...etc).
- Any files outside the /src folder do *not* need to be modified; including test files.
- Use suitable commit messages & [gitflow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) (if necessary)
